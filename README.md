# ECE471 UDP Project

ECE 471 Computer Networks and Data Communications
Project where we will implement an idle-RQ UDP data steam between two machines, a
client (primary) and server (secondary), connected by an ethernet switch. In this UDP
data stream, we will send an image is 1024 byte packets from the primary to the secondary,
where the packets are rebuilt as a copy of the original image.
